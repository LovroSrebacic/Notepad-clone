# Notepad-clone
Notepad clone made in Java

## How it works
For the all functionalities you can either use the keyboard or the toolbar and the menu(mouse is not supported).<br />
This is because the notepad is made so that after every action, main frame is repainted.<br />
<br />
These are the functionalities:
- Moving the cursor
  - Arrow keys
- Selecting text
  - Shift + arrow keys
- Adding letters
  - Letter keys on a keyboard
- Clipboard
  - Copy
    - CTRL + C
  - Cut
    - CTRL + X
  - Paste
    - CTRL + V
  - Paste and pop (paste the last copied text and remove it from the clipboard)
    - CTRL + SHIFT + V
- Undo
  - CTRL + Z
- Redo
  - CTRL + Y
- Open file
  - CTRL + O
- Save file
  - CTRL + S
<br />
Clipboard actions, undo, redo, open and save can be executed also from the menu bar or the toolbar.<br />
At the bottom of the screen there is a status bar that shows current cursor location as well as number of lines in a file.<br /><br />

## Run the program
If you want to test the program yourself you'll need to have java installed on your computer.<br />
If you do have it, you can just run **Notepad-clone.jar** which is located in root folder of this project.
